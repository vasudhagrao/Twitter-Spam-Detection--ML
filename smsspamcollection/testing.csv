Review
"I feel so good to have found heart this used (phone to us & not used hard at all), phone on line from someone who upgraded and sold this one. My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again!!"
"good phone, nice up grade from my pantach revue. Very clean good up and easy set up. never had an android phone but they are fantastic to say the least. perfect size for surfing and social media. great phone samsung"
Very pleased
It works good but it goes slow sometimes but its a very good phone I love it
"Great phone to replace my lost phone. The only thing is the volume up button does not work, but I can still go into settings to adjust. Other than that, it does the job until I am eligible to upgrade my phone again.Thaanks!"
"I already had a phone with problems... I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge. I wish I would have read these comments then I would have not purchased this item.... and its cracked on the side.. damaged goods is what it is.... If trying to charge it another way does not work I am requesting for my money back... AND I WILL GET MY MONEY BACK...SIGNED AN UNHAPPY CUSTOMER...."
The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in.
"Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged, had to buy new battery. Still couldn't stay charged long.so I trashed it.MONEY lost, never again will I buy from this person! !!!"
"I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to the Samsung EPIC 4G for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone, and I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there, just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time. But the camera works great, the video is great as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need. I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2."
It's battery life is great. It's very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate.
"My fiance had this phone previously, but caused many problems. So, of course, we decided to browse amazon for a replacement til' our contract is up! & so far so good!"
"This is a great product it came after two days of ordering it. There was only one little blemish on the side,but who cares as long as the phone is fullly functional.i recommend this product to anyone reading this."
These guys are the best! I had a little situation with my item but they quickly fixed the issue. I was pleased and will definitely be buying another phon from them if I need one.
I'm really disappointed about my phone and service. The phone went out on me over a week ago. Instead of handling it when issue first surfaced. I've been told to do this and do that. Now I'm stick with no phone and I'm out 55 dollars for service that I'm not using. I still haven't received a mailing label to return item. This was my first purchase on amazon. I'm not rushing to use theirs or smartphones 288 business Anytime soon. I thought I was getting a deal but it seems like I'm the one who lucked out.
Ordered this phone as a replacement for the same model until my contract expires and I can get a new one. Seller confirmation said delivery could take up to 7 days. Seller sent out the phone within hours of receiving the order and I had the phone the next day. Phone looks better than described was able to transfer data from the old one to the new one with no problems. Highly recommend this seller
"Had this phone before and loved it but was not working so I got this phone. One thing is the SD card slot does not open up when I try to access it in file managment, even does not show up on the computer. The card is fine was able to open on another phone. Trying to trouble shoot it for now."
"I was able to get the phone I previously owned...with a keyboard and touch screen. It's the best phone and I love it. I still had to clean the device with my service provider, but it was well worth it."
"I brought this phone as a replacement for my daughter, who is very hard on cell phones. I must say it was a great purchase. The phone work wonderful. Thank you"
I love the phone. It does everything I need and works great. I purchased four of these phones through a seller that shipped from Amazon's warehouse. My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card. I couldn't use the camera until I got the card. No problems getting these activated at Sprint.
"unfortunately Sprint could not activate the phone due to the blocking issue with the phone, the matter was handled very well and quickly. Very satisfied with the service."
"The battery was old & had been over used because it barely holds a charge. Otherwise, no issues with the phone itself."
"pros-beautiful screen,capable of running chrome,take good pictures,the keyboard is comfy,fits in my pocket and fit my hands,plays really good videos and gamescons-no Bluetooth,came late,run down fast really quick,doesnt play 1080p videos.but I would still recommend it to those who like to talk and text a lot like me and watch a lot of movies"
I purchased this phone in December as a christmas present to my son. I called sprint to activate the phone only to find out the ESN wasn't clear. I was told to come into the store and upon research the phone wasn't clear. I reached out to this company to inform them that this ESN wasn't clean. I was told to send the phone back and they would send out another phone. I asked the representative to provide me with the ESN # so that I could call and make sure it was clear. I was told that they didn't have to phone available and was guaranteed it would be clear. I should've known something was wrong then. I received a second phone that turned out not have a clear ESN. The representative at Sprint informed me that the seller of these phones are aware the the ESN isn't clear. So once again I had to send another phone back. I asked for a refund for the phone and shipping since the sent me two phones that didn't have a clear ESN. I received my refund for the phone but have yet to see a refund for the shipping. I wouldn't suggest you buy anything from them.
Phone good just a little slow phone old but it's a great phone temporary right now. thank you for the great deal
Phone's speaker little low. Overall very happy with the phone. I would purchase another cell phone from Chubbietech. I am satisfied.
the phone was great and in good condition. My Daughter is so happy the be a andriod user now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"the reasons for the 3 star rating was it was in my opinion better than my iphone 4s but it tends to randomly crash, and randomly power off but it is good for storage space, battery usage, and camera"
Phone works great. No problems at all
was not in good condition but does work good
"Just... not good. The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop."
